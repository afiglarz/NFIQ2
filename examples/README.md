example_api
===========

1. Usage: example_api [-h] _modelInfoFile_ _fingerPrintImage_

2. Output:
	If example_api is able to parse both a NFIQ 2 RF Model and a valid fingerprint image, the expected output will be a list of scores generated from the respective fingerprint image. These scores are the same scores that can be obtained from the NFIQ 2 CLI CSV output. 


	Each score will be printed with its respective header. Each score will be printed on a separate line.


	The first score that gets printed is the NFIQ 2 Quality Score and it will appear as:
		QualityScore: [score]


	The next series of scores will be from actionable feedback. This includes:
		EmptyImageOrContrastTooLow: [value]
		to
		SufficientFingerprintForeground: [value]


	The next series of scores will be quality feature data. These are the scores generated by the individual metrics that comprise the NFIQ 2 quality algorithm. This includes:
		FDA_Bin10_0: [value]
		to
		RVUP_Bin10_StdDev: [value]


	The final series of scores will be speed data. These scores indicate how long (in ms) each metric took to compute. This includes: 
		Frequency domain: [value]
		to
		Ridge valley uniformity: [value]


**NOTE:** The fingerprint images included in the "images" subdirectory are synthetic images generated by SFiNGe.
